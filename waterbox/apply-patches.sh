# Applies the numbered patches to the extern/mame submodule (MAME). Idempotent: a tree
# that already carries the whole series is left alone, a pristine one has it
# applied, and anything in between is an error that names the files.
#
# THE SERIES IS JUDGED AS A WHOLE (ported from chimera-core-rpcs3, where the old
# way stopped a build). Judging a patch at a time - does it apply, else does it
# reverse - cannot work once two patches touch the same place: on a fully
# patched tree the earlier one neither applies nor reverses. Depending on the
# script that either stopped the build on a tree with nothing wrong with it, or
# printed a warning that then hid real ones; and the cheaper tests some cores
# used instead - "the tree has changes", "one file holds a marker" - cannot see
# a tree where a single file was reverted by hand (git checkout -- file), which
# silently drops that file's share of several patches and builds anyway.
#
# So: what the series SHOULD leave behind is worked out on a scratch copy - the
# touched files as the submodule's HEAD has them, with every patch applied in
# order - and the working tree is compared with that.
